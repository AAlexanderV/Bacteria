Bacteria evolution simulator

The rules of evolution are simple! The life of a Bact depends on the availability of food and how quickly it can get to that food.

You can place as much food and Bacts as you want. Notethat if there is not enough food, the Bact will die.Having eaten enough, Bacts multiply and give half of theaccumulated food to children - this is how new Bacts areborn. The child inherits:

-   the color of the parent by 100%;
-   a speed close to the parent with equal chances of 3 possible scenarios: either the same speed of the parent, or +/- 1 to the speed of the parent.

Game Instruction:

-   By default you start with 1 bacteria of each type/color with the speed of 3. Colors are random.
-   The more food the Bact eats, the bigger size it gets.  

-   Getting bigger increases its need for food (consumption per second) and also its speed, that allows the Bact to be more competitive in gaining the food. The largest Bacts are the fastest and vice versa.
-   Summarized statistics on colors alive and mutated speeds can be found in the right corner.

Game Control:

-   To place food: click the right mouse button or press “+/- 30 Food” at the control panel located on the left. The Food appears randomly.
-   To create a Bact: click the left mouse button or press “+ 5 Bacts” at the same control panel.
-   It is up to you how many Bacts and food to place – there is no limit.

P.S. Be careful not to exaggerate the number of food.Your PC may not have enough power to handle so manyBacts born.
